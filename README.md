# Opinion Mining on Tweets

**Summary:** 

- Collected real-time tweets and applied VADER to quantify the positivity/negativity of the tweets.
- Observed the values and tried to predict why people in various cities are upset or happy.
- Built models (Neural Networks & Regression) to predict variables which might affect the positivity/negativity of a tweet.

Nowadays, as a data analyst, we are not required anymore standing at the street side asking for people’s opinion or trying to gather data from people regarding a specific subject. Thanks to social media such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc., people are happily expressing their emotion, story and feelings online voluntarily. Over 126 million daily users on twitter posting over 500 million tweets per day, that are almost 6,000 tweets every second. 

With this huge data bank, there are so many opportunities and ideas can be used in research, such as the election’s result, how good/bad the economy in a country, or even the happiness of a city can be predicted by using these tweets.

In 2019, Marrisa Perino  from Business Insider published an article titled “The 50 happiest cities in America, ranked”. Their team (WalletHub) has evaluated 182 nation’s big cities to rank these cities’ happiness by using various indicators such as sleep rate and hate crime incidents.

What I believe is, we can also achieve a similar result to understand the happiness of a city by using the tweets collected and build a model to predict it. At the same time, I am also interested on what features or independent variables could justify the tweets’ sentiment.
