# Opinion Mining on Tweets

• Collected real-time tweets and applied VADER to quantify the positivity/negativity of the tweets.

• Observed the values and tried to predict why people in various cities are upset or happy.

• Built models (Neural Networks & Regression) to predict variables which might affect the positivity/negativity of a tweet.
